# C++ simple guide 

## Notes

Compiling in C++ is different depending the OS you are using.

Asumming you are using g++ for compiling, on Windows the command is the next:

- **g++ namefile.cpp -o namefile.exe**

On Linux the command is the next:

- **g++ namefile.cpp -o namefile**


This is because Linux do not work on executables with .exe extension.

### I.Basics

- hello-world -> The first app we all made when we coding at first time.

- add-numbers -> Adds numbers from 1 to the number the user typed.

- avg-array -> Find the average between 5 numbers.

- counter -> Count numbers from 1 to 10.

- counter2 -> Count numbers from 1 to the user's number has typed.

- even-odd -> Says if the number typed is even or odd.

- factorial -> Finds the factorial of the number typed.

- maths -> Code that performs basic maths operations.

- max-number -> Finds the maximum of 3 numbers typed.

- multiply-table -> Shows the multiply table of any number typed.

- numbers -> Simple program that adds 2 numbers typed.
  
- prime-number -> Finds if the number typed are prime or not.

- random-number -> Minigame that consists in guessing the random number.

- rev-array -> Code that reverts an array.

- vowels -> Counts the vowels on a sentence.

- pal-number -> Finds if the number typed are palindrome or not.

### II.Basic_Structures

- linked-lists -> Explain what linked list are and contains functions to manipulate on them.

- dynamic-arrays -> In C++ we work on vectors in dynamics arrays for their safety interaction,
                    this file contains CRUD functions and other complementary features to work on vectors(dynamic arrays).

- stack-queues -> Explains how stacks and queues works for managing tasks.
